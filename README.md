# particle-simulation
Just a small circle physics simulation. Plan on adding more functions

Right now what it has:
  - Inter-circle collisions
  - Wall placing and collision (buggy)
  - Different colors
  - Rainbow colors!
  - Unmoving (static) circles (a bit buggy too)
  - Lots of bugs with wall collisions

You can create, delete and paint circles, and also create walls!
The simulation is quite fast and can handle ~700-800 circles without much lag on an ~medium-average laptop

You can change the code however you like - there are some function that didn't make it into UI,
but you can change, for example, maxParticles from 1000 to whatever you like, and the ball size randomization, and the bounds size only from code.

Have fun :)
